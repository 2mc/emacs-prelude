What happens if you do a publication or a conference presentation for a project?
It's easy:
It's still a publication or a conference project, because you want to list later on all your publications, conferences installations etc.  So the logic of it is: The documents that get a project prefix like EASTN are those that pertain to the management and communication of the project (only).  The outcomes of the project can be "products", items that have their own life in the broader context of other activities such as publications, concerts, performances, installations, lectures,

** To parse these from an orgmode node tree:

The example below deals with a 3-level hierarchy.  In the final application planned here, only a 2-level hierarchy will be used:
1. PROJECT
2. ACTIVITY

For the third level, DOCTYPE, all docs share one and the same list.

3. if level == 1
   - append new list with this heading
     () becomes (("HEADING"))
     (("HEADING1" ...)) becomes (("HEADING1 ...) ("HEADING2"))
   - Set current level 1 to ("HEADING2")
4. if level == 2
   - append new list to current level 1
     ("HEADING1") becomes ("HEADING1" ("SUBHEADING1"))
   - set current level 2 to newly appended element ("SUBHEADING2")
5. if level == 3
   - append new element to current level 2.

Do the appending by going:

For the case of levels 1 and 2:
: (setcdr (last <list>) (list (list <new-element>)))

For the case of level 3:
: (setcdr (last <list>) (list <new-element>))
