These are the contents of folder "personal" in my .emacs.d folder.

I use emacs-prelude (https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) to manage configuration.

This loads all emacs-lisp files in folder "preload" first, and then runs init.el.

My init.el first adds all packages from folder "packages" to the load path to make them available.  Then it runs my init file, which is user/iani2.org.

iani2.org contains all the configuration code, as org-babel blocks containing emacs-lisp.

The present repository also contains chuck-mode, for the computer music language ChucK and sclang for SuperCollider.
